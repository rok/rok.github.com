It was a late Sunday evening.
I migrated from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and it was a lot of fun.

I used [feeburner](https://www.feedburner.com) for RSS, [disqus](https://www.disqus.com/) for comments, textile for markup, [google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) for .. well analytics, heroku for [hosting](https://www.heroku.com/), [dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) for DNS, [google apps](https://apps.google.com) for e-mail, and [git](https://git-scm.com/)
 to deploy.
Win.
