After living in "Victor Jara Wohnheim":http://www.studentenwerk-berlin.de/wohnen/studentische_wohnanlagen/biesdorf/index.html in Biesdorf for six months, I'm moving to a sublet room in "Potsdamerstrasse":http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Potsdamer+Stra%C3%9Fe+103,+Berlin,+Nem%C4%8Dija&layer=c&sll=52.500457,13.363674&cbp=13,124.49,,0,-7.69&cbll=52.500501,13.363416&hl=sl&sspn=0.006295,0.006295&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Potsdamer+Stra%C3%9Fe+103,+Berlin+10785+Berlin,+Nem%C4%8Dija&ll=52.500503,13.36342&spn=0.003827,0.009645&z=17&panoid=O-OZ4t56FHdgs6a3vwuY5A for one month, before moving on to find something together with Tadeja for the rest of my stay in Berlin.
I'm not sure what to make of this move actually. I'm still confused about Victor Jara anyway. But I guess there's no point in overreflecting on any of this. Life is a dance afterall.

In Victor Jara I was staying in a single room with a miniature kitchen and a bathroom. Although it was very cosy and practical I was never completly happy with it and I'm not completely sure why. The location (halfway to Warszaw) was mostly to blame I think.

And now begins La vita nuova, somewhere in Schoneberg.
